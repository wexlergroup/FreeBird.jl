"""
    pbc_dist(pos1, pos2, at)

Compute the distance between two positions considering periodic boundary conditions. Currently only works for orthorhombic lattices.

# Arguments
- `pos1::Union{SVector{T},Vector{T}}`: The first position.
- `pos2::Union{SVector{T},Vector{T}}`: The second position.
- `at::AbstractSystem`: The abstract system containing boundary conditions and bounding box.

# Returns
- `d::Float64`: The distance between `pos1` and `pos2` considering periodic boundary conditions.
